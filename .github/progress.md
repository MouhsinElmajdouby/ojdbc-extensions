    + Added a missing test for `VaultUsernameProvider` to improve test coverage.
    + The PR has been merged.

- TNSNames Provider for GCP:
    + Created a PR to add support for the TNSNames Provider in GCP Secret Manager, handling both Base64-encoded and raw file formats.
    + Updated the parameter name to `tnsAlias` for consistency with other parameters.
    + Addressed feedback, and the PR is under review.

- Documentation:
    + Updated the Confluence page to reflect the latest changes, including new providers and refactored logic. https://confluence.oraclecorp.com/confluence/display/DBJAVA/Proposal%3A+ConnectionStringProvider+from+OCI+Vault%2C+Azure+Key+Vault+and+GCP+Secret+Manager

- Current Work:
    + Developing the TNSNames Provider for OCI to align with Azure and GCP implementations.
    + Refactoring the `getSecret` methods in GCP and Azure providers to use the common `getResource` method for centralized resource retrieval.
